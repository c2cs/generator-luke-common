# Project Scaffold: "luke:app" ([source](../../generators/app/index.js))

A [project scaffold](../project-scaffolds.md) that can be used to create or
recreate a basic, minimal, project.

This [project scaffold](../project-scaffolds.md) is the _default_ [sub-generator](../generators.md).

## Usage Example

Explicit usage:

```
$ yo luke:app
```

Because this is the _default_ [sub-generator](../generators.md), you can
abbreviate its usage and can specify it, implicitly, like so:

```
$ yo luke
```
