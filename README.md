# Luke's Yeoman Generator

> Yeoman generator for scaffolding basic projects.  I give this generator to
developers who work for and with me in order to maintain consistent project
structure.  Although it was built for my own use, anyone can use it.

## Basic Usage

### Install

Install `yo`, and `generator-luke`:

```
npm install -g yo generator-luke
```

### Run it

Run `yo luke`

```
yo luke
```
