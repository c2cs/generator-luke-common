Test Fixtures
==========================================

A test fixture is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for 
running tests. The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well 
known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. 

### Examples of fixtures:

* Preparation of input data and setup/creation of fake or mock objects
* Loading a database with a specific, known set of data
* Copying a specific known set of files creating a test fixture will create a set 
of objects initialized to certain states.
